            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Rajput-Mughal War (1679–1707) stands as one of the most significant conflicts in Indian history. It symbolized the indomitable spirit of the Rajputs, led by the valiant Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, against the oppressive imperialism of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. This war was not merely a battle for territorial supremacy but also a struggle to protect cultural and religious freedom.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In 1679, Aurangzeb reintroduced the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which ignited widespread resentment across India. The Rajputs, known for their commitment to dharma and freedom, considered this move a direct assault on their autonomy and traditions. Rana Raj Singh, the ruler of Mewar, emerged as the leader of the resistance, rallying other Rajput clans to stand against the Mughal hegemony.</p>

            <h2>The War Begins</h2>
            <p>The conflict escalated in 1679 when Aurangzeb attacked Mewar, seeking to subdue its proud people. Rana Raj Singh displayed exceptional leadership, employing guerrilla tactics to counter the Mughal army's numerical superiority. Historical records, such as James Tod's *Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan*, emphasize the heroism of Rajput warriors during this period.</p>

            <h2>Climactic Battles</h2>
            <p>The battles were fierce and relentless. In the Battle of Aravalli (1680), the Rajputs achieved a significant victory, forcing the Mughals to retreat. Rana Raj Singh's alliance with other kingdoms, including Marwar and Amber, demonstrated the unity of the Rajputana against a common foe. Mughal chronicles, including the *Maasir-i-Alamgiri*, record Aurangzeb’s frustration with the prolonged resistance.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>The war continued until 1707, culminating in the weakening of Mughal authority in Rajputana. Rana Raj Singh's defiance inspired future generations, cementing his legacy as a hero who stood for justice and sovereignty. Modern historians, such as Satish Chandra, note this period as a turning point in Mughal decline.</p>
