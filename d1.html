                        <p class="para"><span class="highlight">Afzal Khan</span>, confident of his strength, attempted to lure Shivaji into an open battle. Shivaji, understanding the danger of facing a superior force head-on, instead agreed to meet Afzal Khan for a diplomatic discussion under the guise of a truce. The meeting was arranged at the base of Pratapgarh. Both leaders were to come unarmed, accompanied by a few bodyguards, to negotiate. But Shivaji, aware of Afzal Khan's treachery, prepared carefully. Beneath his flowing robes, he concealed a small weapon called a wagh nakh (tiger claw) and a dagger.</p>
