            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                By the mid-17th century, the Mughal Empire, under Emperor Aurangzeb, sought to consolidate its control over the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent. 
                Assam, ruled by the Ahom dynasty since the 13th century, became a focal point for Mughal expansion due to its strategic location and wealth. 
                The Mughals had attempted to invade Assam on several occasions, culminating in the massive campaign of 1671.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mughal offensive followed their earlier victory in the Battle of Pandu (1663), which had temporarily subdued the Ahoms. However, the resilient Ahom forces, 
                under King Chakradhwaj Singha, regrouped under the leadership of Lachit Borphukan, who was appointed as the supreme commander (<em>Borphukan</em>) of the Ahom army in 1667.

            <h2>The Battle of Saraighat</h2>
            <p>
                The decisive phase of the battle began in March 1671. The Mughal navy, under the command of Raja Ram Singh I, advanced towards Saraighat, 
                a critical point on the Brahmaputra. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Ahoms leveraged their intimate knowledge of the river's geography and employed guerrilla tactics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lachit Borphukan's strategy was to draw the Mughal fleet into narrow river channels where their mobility and firepower would be limited. 
                The Ahom forces used surprise attacks, night raids, and hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the Mughal formations. These skirmishes culminated in a large-scale confrontation near Saraighat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Lachit was severely ill during the battle, he famously declared, <strong>“I shall not let my country be enslaved, even if it costs me my life.”</strong> 
                Ignoring his condition, he personally led the final charge, inspiring his troops to launch a ferocious counteroffensive. The Ahom navy's agility and tactical superiority 
                overwhelmed the Mughal fleet, forcing them to retreat in disarray.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                The Mughal retreat from Saraighat marked a turning point in the Ahom-Mughal conflict. It reaffirmed the sovereignty of the Ahom Kingdom and temporarily halted 
                Mughal expansion into the Northeast. Although the Mughals maintained nominal control over parts of Lower Assam, they never again launched a campaign of such magnitude against the Ahoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The victory at Saraighat is commemorated annually on <strong>Lachit Divas</strong> (November 24) in honor of Lachit Borphukan's patriotism and leadership. 
                The battle remains a symbol of Assamese pride and resistance against tyranny.
