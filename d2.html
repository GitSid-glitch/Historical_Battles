                        The battle was intense and marked by heavy casualties on both sides.
                        The Vijayanagara forces breached the defenses, it resulted in a decisive victory for Vijayanagara forces, and the Bijapur ruler was defeated and pushed across the river Krishna. 
                    The defeat weakened the Bijapur Sultanate and heightened tensions between the Deccan Sultanates and Vijayanagara.
